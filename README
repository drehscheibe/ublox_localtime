ublox_localtime configures a ublox neo-6 (or later) GPS receiver chip to send
binary UBX NAV_TIMEUTC messages over the USB-serial interface. The received time
is then converted to local time CET/MEZ (A time, UTC +1) or CEST/MESZ (B time,
UTC +2) according to the DST rules of the EU (switch at 0100 UTC on the last
Sunday in March and October). Date and time is displayed once per second together
with the weekday and the ISO calendar week number.

The sole purpose of this project is to play with the ublox receiver and to
prepare for its use in an MCU clock project using libopencm3 and libnewlib.
That's why the core elements of this code don't depend on sophisticated
libraries and the calendar functions don't make plausibility checks for
arguments. This is left as an exercise to the user.  :-)
